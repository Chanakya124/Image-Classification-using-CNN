This project focuses on building an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a deep learning technique widely used for image recognition tasks. The model is trained on a labeled dataset, extracting features like edges, shapes, and textures to classify images into predefined categories. The architecture leverages convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for final classification.

Key Features:

Preprocessing of images including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
Implementation of CNN layers such as convolution, pooling, dropout, and dense layers.
Training and evaluation on popular datasets like CIFAR-10.
Visualization of training metrics and model predictions.

This project is designed to demonstrate the power of CNNs in handling image data and achieving accurate classifications for various real-world applications.
